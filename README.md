DenseAlert: Incremental Dense-SubTensor Detection in Tensor Streams
========================

**DenseStream** is an incremental algorithm for detecting dense subtensors in tensor streams, and
**DenseAlert** is an incremental algorithm for spotting suddenly emerging dense subtensors.
They have the following properties:
 * *Fast and 'Any Time'*: By maintaining and updating a dense subtensor, our algorithms detect a dense subtensor in a tensor stream significantly faster than batch algorithms.
 * *Provably Accurate*: Our algorithms provide theoretical guarantees on their accuracy, and show high accuracy in practice.
 * *Effective*: Our algorithms successfully identifies anomalies, such as bot activities, rating manipulations, and network intrusions, in real-world tensors.
